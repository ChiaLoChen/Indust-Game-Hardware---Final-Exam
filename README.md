# Indust-Game-Hardware---Final-Exam
design steps:
1. try to re-arrange my initial name "Chia Lo Chen" into a controller shape
2. list what game I wish to use this controller on
3. create a tinkerCAD featuring the inputs, sensors, and actuator
4. use Fusion to create the CAD prototype
5. create the 3D parts
6. create the Assembly
7. create the Exploded view
8. create the Technical drawings
9. create the Bill of materials

Explanations:

What was done

- A controller with my initial name that can be used in a FPS game
- includes up, down, right, left movements
- includes attack, reload, swap weapons, and knife buttons

How it was done

- using letters in my name as button placements and on press triggers the function
- When the buttons are pressed the Arduino would read the analogue and digital input and then output the corresponded function

Why it was done the way it was

- I noticed two parts of my name have four letters which is similar to a X-box controller buttons
- I figure a controller similar to X box would be the most common and simple solution to get work done in time
